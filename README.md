# House Prices Prediction

This project predicts house sale prices using the well-known Kaggle "House Prices — Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset. It demonstrates exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling using Jupyter Notebooks.

## What’s in this repo
- Jupyter Notebooks with EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Code and analysis focused on building regression models to predict house prices.

## Dataset
The original dataset is from Kaggle:
- House Prices — Advanced Regression Techniques: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

(You must download the dataset from Kaggle and place the CSV files into the repository or a data/ folder before running the notebooks.)

## Quick start
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/oelanr/house-prices-prediction.git
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
3. Install typical dependencies (example):
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost notebook
4. Launch Jupyter:
   jupyter notebook
5. Open the project notebooks and run cells in order.

## Notes
- The notebooks are designed to be readable and educational: they include plots, feature analysis, and model comparison.
- Results will vary depending on preprocessing choices and model hyperparameters.

## Contributing
If you want to improve the notebooks, add modeling experiments, or include a requirements file, feel free to open a PR or an issue.
